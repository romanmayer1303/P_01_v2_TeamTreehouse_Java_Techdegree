Guess how many are in the Jar Game

Treehouse Java Web Development Project 01

This is a guessing game. The user is prompted for a type of item that goes into the jar (e.g. bananas). Then he is
prompted for the maximum number of items the jar can hold. A new jar object is created, filled with a random number of
items between 1 and the maximum number of items.

Then the game begins and the user has to guess how many items are in the jar.

The project has three classes: Prompter.java, Jar.java, GuessingGame.java
